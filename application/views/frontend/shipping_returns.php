        <strong>How do I track my order?</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">
        The best way to check your order status is to sign-up at www.Royalhomes.in and go to the order tracking page:&nbsp;https://www.Royalhomes.in/index.php?route=account/track. We try our best to deliver your Product before you can even think 'Where is it now?' :) i.e. well within 10 days of your order (or 10 days of the promised shipment date in the case of pre-orders). In a few cases however, we take closer to our promised 12 - 15 days for delivery. In such cases, we proactively call / email the customer to inform them of the status of their product and where it is in transit. In the rare case when you have not received any communication from us for 10 days after order (or 10 days after promised shipment date in the case of pre-orders) do give us a call at our customer care number or email us at Care@Royalhomes.in.</li>
